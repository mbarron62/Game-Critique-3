Designer- Traveller's Tales
raveller's Tales was founded in 1989 by Jon Burton. Initially a small company focused on its own content, it grew in profile through developing games with larger companies such as Sega and Disney Interactive Studios. In 1996, the company incorporated under the name Currentclass, but changed its name to Travellers Tales (UK), doing business as Traveller's Tales, two months later. In 2004, development on Lego Star Wars: The Video Game started with publisher Giant Interactive Entertainment, and, the following year Traveller's Tales purchased and merged with Giant Interactive Entertainment, forming TT Games. From that point, Traveller's Tales served as the company's development branch, while Giant Interactive Entertainment became TT Games Publishing, the publishing branch. In 2007, the company acquired another developer and an animation studio, which became TT Fusion and TT Animation. On 8 November 2007, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment announced that they had purchased TT Games for an undisclosed amount as part of their expansion into the video game industry.

Final Thoughts- If you like the LEGO game formula, you have a preference for playing solo and you’re a huge fan of MCU, there’s still a lot of value for you in LEGO Marvel’s Avengers, even despite a disjointed plot and annoying audio mixes. If you haven’t played any of the others and you’re thinking about picking up this one, I’d advise starting with just about any other game instead. This the weakest LEGO game I’ve played thus far, and had me missing games like LEGO Marvel Super Heroes and LEGO Dimensions.

Aspects that should have been tested-
1. Lots of bugs and glitches, crashes (frequently every now and then for me, graphic card or hardware problem keep coming up

2. The archive audio of the Avengers actors (Jeremy Renner, Robert Downey Jr, Scarlett Johansson, Chris Evans, etc) is really bad, when playing the campaign or story or other missions, while battling, the audio is so low that you can't hear a thing, how I noticed that was because of the subtitles, telling that audio was coming out but was very low to be honest.

3. You can't access a map (like in Superheroes), you have to rely on a small radar at all costs, which is weird and dumb, also you can't teleport to certain parts of the map.

5. The flying controls are fixed up, but the camera angles for it suck, you can't see above meaning you don't know whether or not you're heading to the helicarrier.

6. The game forces you to play 15-20% of the story which is about 5-8 missions just to free roam.

7. It has way too much DLC, and it a too costly expect the Spider-Man one was free.

8. I don't like that the game is Sunset all the time, I liked Superheroes stayed daytime all the time, so you could see the natural colors of the city, stuff like that. This is my own opinion.

9. Customization was terrible, it copied it from Superheroes and didn't bothering making new changes. Where you can actually customize your character and making abilities separate rather than have Spidey's face or a weapon just to get the character's abilities, it was turd, the customization
